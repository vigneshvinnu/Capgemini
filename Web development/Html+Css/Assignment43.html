    <kbd>     Access to Facebook is free of charge, and the company earns most of its money from advertisements
        on the Web site. New users can create profiles, upload photos, join a preexisting group, and start
        new groups. The site has many components, including Timeline, a space on each user’s profile page where
        users can post their content and friends can post messages; Status, which enables users to alert friends
        to their current location or situation; and News Feed, which informs users of changes to their friends’
        profiles and status. Users can chat with each other and send each other private messages. Users can signal
        their approval of content on Facebook with the Like button, a feature that also appears on many other Web
        sites.</kbd>

    <kbd>         Instagram (commonly abbreviated to IG or Insta)[7] is an American photo and video sharing
        social networking service owned by Facebook, created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger and originally
        launched on iOS in October 2010. The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a
        feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10
        in October 2016. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by
        hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can
        browse other users' content by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can like photos and
        follow other users </kbd>

    <kbd>Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact
        with messages known as "tweets". Registered users can post, like and retweet tweets, but unregistered
        users can only read them. Users access Twitter through its website interface or its mobile-device
        application software ("app"), though the service could also be accessed via SMS before April 2020.
        Twitter, Inc. is based in San Francisco, California, and has more than 25 offices around the world.
        Tweets were originally restricted to 140 characters, but was doubled to 280 for non-CJK languages in
        November 2017. Audio and video tweets remain limited to 140 seconds for most accounts.</kbd>
